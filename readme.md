# Northwind Traders Sales & Orders Analysis

An analysis of a fictional dataset about the sales and orders of a fictional gourmet food supplier named Northwind Traders.

The dataset is provided by the good people in [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground)

# Goal
The purpose of this analysis is to build an airtight, intuitive, interactive, and reliable dashboard to allow the higher-ups of our company to gain key performance insights at a glance.
I also plan on putting together a report summarizing key insights, and some recommendations. Whether I'll do it in PowerBI or PowerPoint using those that neat add-in is something I'm still debating about. I hope I won't forget to update this section.
Or that's what I would've said if I didn't just install a VSCodium extension that bookmarks code hehe. Problem solved.

# Tools used:
- Notepad++ and its add-on, CSV Lint, for quick CSV importing into MySQL Workbench. It also allows you to set primary keys, constraints, it's an essential tool for any data analyst that uses SQL.
- MySQL Workbench for cleaning and querying
- Power BI for data modeling and visualization.
